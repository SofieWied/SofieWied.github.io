            <h2>Why use data visualisations?</h2>
            <p>Data visualisation transforms complexity into clarity. In an era of information overload, well-designed charts enable policymakers and citizens alike to grasp patterns, identify trends, and make evidence-based decisions. Effective visualisation doesn't merely display numbers - it tells stories, reveals relationships, and provokes critical questions that raw data alone cannot answer. Yet as Hans Rosling reminds us, poor visualisation can obscure rather than illuminate: the difference between insight and confusion often lies in thoughtful design choices.</p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Masters student in Data Science for Public Policy at the London School of Economics. My focus is on how data can be 
                used to inform decision making, especially in policy settings. [PLACEHOLDER: Add more about your background, 
                interests, or what drives your passion for data visualization.]
            </p>
            <p>
                The charts on this page are my final submission for the PP434 Automated Data Visualisation for Policymaking course. 
                If there is one thing I've learnt throughout this course, it is that creating "good" charts is as much an art as it 
                is a science. Browse the links below to see my attempt at striking this balance.
